The average distance, known as the mean distance, is approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles or 238,900 nautical miles. However, this distance can range from a minimum of about 363,104 kilometers (225,622 miles or 121,800 nautical miles (perigee) to a maximum of around 406,747 kilometers (252,865 miles or 154,068 nautical miles (apogee) during its orbit around the Earth. The closest the Moon comes to Earth is during a full moon, which is called a supermoon, and it is called a perigee, and the furthest point in its orbit is called an apogee. During apogee, the distance between the Moon and the Earth can reach up to 406,700,000 kilometers (252,430 miles or 152,780 nautical miles. These variations in distance are known as lunar variations or lunar ranges.'}\n"
