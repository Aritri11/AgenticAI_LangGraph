The programme aims to allocate INR 7,500 crore (approximately USD 1 billion) for the same and takes inspiration from the UK's governmental approach to AI. The NPAI's strategic interventions for research, development, and adoption of AI will lead to a 10x boost in the AI industry's size by 2025. By 2025, it intends to make India a top destination for AI research and talent, with the following objectives:\\n\\nA. Encouraging research and development of AI: The NPAI focuses on supporting research and development in fundamental AI areas such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.\\nB. Promoting AI startups: NPAI empowers AI startups through funding, incubation, and tax incentives, leading to the emergence of AI-based products and services.\\nC. Addressing social challenges: The programme aims to leverage AI in agriculture, healthcare, education, smart cities, and other sectors to solve local problems.\\n\\nII. National Strategy for AI (NSAI): The strategy targets AI-led economic growth and national security, and it gives a roadmap for AI's implementation in various domains, including healthcare, agriculture, and education.
